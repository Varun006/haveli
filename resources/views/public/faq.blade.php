							<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-question-sign"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-question-sign"></i>What is the meaning of “BRAHMA SAMBANDH”?
							</div>
							<div class="togglec">As explained by Shri Mahaprabhuji the human nature is susceptible to bad influences. As soon as a man is born, he automatically catches five kinds of ills which make him forget his true identity. He even forgets that he is part of god and his main object is to meet the God. He is not unhappy about the fact that he has forgotten God from last thousands of years. He is not even anxious to meet the God because he is trapped in worldly things and thinks that he is one separate from the God. He does not appreciate that every living thing is part and parcel of God. Whatever happens in this world is as per his wish since man is not capable of doing `something, which is not approved by the God. But a man thinks otherwise, he thinks that he himself is God and he can do everything on this earth. He believes that he is the owner of his properties and that it is he, who does everything. Therefore, he becomes sad when something believed to be owned by him is lost. He runs around to find happiness in worldly things and therefore after death he takes several birth and rebirths. With a view to show correct path to the people, Mahaprabhuji has given a Mantra having eighty four letters, which is Prose form and five letters Mantra which is known as Brahma Sambandh.<br><br>
							Mantra of Brahma Sambandh can be classified in three parts, viz. In the first part Man realises his true identity when he meets God face to face; in the second part he gives up everything go God which he falsely believed of his own. This includes his properties, his body and soul and in third part he promises to take shelter forever at the feet of God. Thus, he becomes a liberated soul.
